introduction,questionnaire,,descriptive,"Dear Participant, 
Thank you very much for taking part in this survey that is part of the CLEARER study (Current cLinical scEnARios for the use of cefidErocol in multidrug-Resistant infections: a case study-based approach) supported by GARDP. We aim at investigating how cefiderocol is used or may be used at your institution. We also ask for some details related to the characteristics of your hospital and the antimicrobial resistance patterns that you often see.  
If you don't know the answers, or cannot retrieve the information, you can leave the space blank.
The survey is anonymous; however, if you would like to be involved in the CLEARER working group-related publication, please leave your name and email address in the boxes below. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
